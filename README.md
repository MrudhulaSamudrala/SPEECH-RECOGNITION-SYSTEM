**INTERN ID** : CT120FHK

**DOMAIN** : ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

**DURATION** : 8 WEEKS

**MENTOR** : NEELA SANTHOSH


## DESCRIPTION :

**Project Overview** :
This project implements a speech recognition system using Wav2Vec2, a powerful transformer-based model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It converts spoken audio into text with high accuracy. The interface is built using Gradio, allowing users to easily test the model with recorded or uploaded audio files.

**Tools & Libraries Used**:
Gradio – For creating a user-friendly web interface.

Librosa – For audio processing and feature extraction.

Torch (PyTorch) – Deep learning framework for model inference.

Transformers (Hugging Face) – Provides the pre-trained Wav2Vec2ForCTC model.

**Applications**
1. Voice Assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)

2. Transcription Services (e.g., converting meetings or lectures into text)
   
3. Accessibility (helping hearing-impaired users with real-time captions)

4. Voice Commands (hands-free control for smart devices)

5. Multilingual Speech Recognition (adapting to various languages and accents)

**How It Works**

1️. Load and preprocess the audio input using Librosa.

2️. Use a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 model for feature extraction and transcription.

3️. Display the recognized text using Gradio's web-based UI.
